# TCD-CS3107-Social-Computing
## Michaelmas Term 2015/2016

T am leading the autumn offering of CS3107 in the BSc Information Systems programme in the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin.
I conceived this module in 2010 and have offered it over the past few years. It has evolved thanks to the thoughtful participation of the students who have participated in it.
I hope that this year's offering will again lead to a further evolution of the shape and mode in which this module is offered.
During 2013 the module was offered entirely via social media due to resource constraints. This experiment lead to discovery by both me as well as the participants.
