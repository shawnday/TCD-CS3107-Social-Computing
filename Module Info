## THE MODULE
### Welcome to CS3107 Social Computing

Over the next eleven weeks we will explore a wide variety of topics and trends in Social Media and Computing as we consider the impact of technology on society and its reciprocal relationship. As we are studying Social Computing it certainly seems only natural that we employ the tools and processes that we are studying as a part of our own practice. So … from today we will interact both in person as well as a variety of online means to reflect on how these change the way in which we interact and how they can be effectively employed to share knowledge.

This module will provide an overview of social computing and its evolving impacts on society and business processes and practice. To this end, you will gain first-hand experience of the ways in which social computing technologies can be applied by individuals, communities and organisations.

Social computing encompasses such phenomena as social networking, Enterprise 2.0, internet activism/advocacy, crowdsourcing, e-Government/Government 2.0, social/viral marketing, social information processing, social network analysis and the use of blogging, podcasts, wikis and other collaboration tools. We are going to learn and reflect by doing.

Social computing has altered the ways in which individuals and organisations interact with information systems as well as with each other. New and emerging platforms and services raise new issues that provide new avenues of engagement but come with pitfalls that challenge its smooth embrace by enterprise.

So let’s get started.

On this portal you will find the information you need to participate in this module as well as many of the mechanisms by which we will interact. We will employ a variety of mainstream tools and information about them will be introduced as we need them on a week by week basis.
